# SCFA Correlation Analysis with Microbial Genera

This repository contains the R script and relevant data files used for correlation analysis between bovine gut microbial genera and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

---

## üìä Project Overview

The analysis includes:

- Correlation of microbial genera with SCFAs (e.g., acetate, butyrate)
- Multiple testing correction (FDR)
- Heatmap visualization of significant correlations
- PCoA (Principal Coordinates Analysis) and PERMANOVA for group clustering
- Environmental fitting of SCFAs onto PCoA ordination
